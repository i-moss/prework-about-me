      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I currently work at Northwestern in admin, but do graphic design for a community-directed urban development firm on the side. Apart from some courses on Free Code Camp and Harvard's CS50 course I haven't done anything related to coding, but I've really enjoyed what I've learned so far and am excited to build some cool stuff.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Seattle, WA</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Chess</li>
        <li>Rock climbing</li>
        <li>Backpacking</li>
        <li>Cycling</li>
        <li>Baking new breads</li>
        <li>Pottery</li>
      </ul>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I think I have a lot of dream jobs that would actually be annoying to do in reality, but being a foley artist always sounded so cool.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Rogers Park, Chicago, IL</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I really enjoy learning about coding and trying to build things online. I've tried out a lot of different job paths, from grantwriter to journalist to mental health counselor, but this is the first one that has really clicked for me. I'd love to be able to build tools and websites for journalists, museums and storytellers.</p>
