      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Learning how to code.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Seattle, WA</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Chess</li>
        <li>Rock climbing</li>
        <li>Backpacking</li>

      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I think I have a lot of dream jobs that would actually be annoying to do in reality, but being a foley artist always sounded so cool. I also think it would be interesting to be a medical anthropologist studying addiction, or maybe a Park Ranger?</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Rogers Park, Chicago, IL</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I really enjoy learning about coding and trying to build things online. I feel like this is the first time that I've studied something that will lead to a job I would not only see value in, but also enjoy. I'd love to be able to build tools and websites for journalists, museums and storytellers.</p>
